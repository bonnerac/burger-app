# Burger-App


## Description
A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

## Goals

This app is designed to use list of your favorite burgers. You should be able to:
* Create a new burger
* See your list of burgers
* Update a burger
* Delete a burger (using the "devoured" button)


## Complications

During the process of making this burger site, I did run into some problems: 

* Updating and Deleting
    * While the app creates burgers and adds them to your list, I was unable to get them to delete/update like I wanted them to.

## Credits and Thanks
